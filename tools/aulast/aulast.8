.TH AULAST: "8" "Nov 2008" "Red Hat" "System Administration Utilities"
.SH NAME
aulast \- a program similar to last
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aulast [ -f file ] [ --bad ] [ --stdin ] [ user ] [ tty ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBaulast\fP is a program that prints out a listing of the last logged in users similarly to the program \fBlast\fP and \fBlastb\fP. Aulast searches back through the audit logs or the given audit log file and displays a list of all users logged in (and out) based on the range of time in the audit logs. Names of users and ttyâ€™s can be given, in which case aulast will show only those entries matching the arguments. Names of ttys can be abbreviated, thus aulast 0 is the same as last tty0.

The pseudo user reboot logs in each time the system is rebooted. Thus last reboot will show a log of all reboots since the log file was created.

The main difference that a user will notice is that \fBaulast\fP print events from oldest to newest, while \fBlast\fP prints records from newest to oldest. Also, the audit system is not notified each time a tty or pty is allocated, so you may not see quite as many records indicating users and their tty's.
